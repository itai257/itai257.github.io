# Authorization in .Net

In this blog post I'll try to cover some of the main methods to apply authorization in .NET app 
<br />
This post will be divided to 3 main subjects:
- Basic authorization
- Policy based authorization
- Role / Claim based authorization


## Basic authorization
In its most basic form, the way to enforce request to be authenticated is when using the `[Authorize]` attribute 
<br> 
it can be applied on different levels with different granularity 
```csharp

```

# Notes for self
- when using .net authorization you have to add authentication and define what scheme you are using (bearer/cookie/etc..)
